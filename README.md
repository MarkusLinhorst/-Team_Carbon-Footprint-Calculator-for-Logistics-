7. Carbon Footprint Calculator for Logistics 

Description: Develop a calculator that estimates the carbon footprint for different modes of transportation (e.g., air, road, sea) based on distance and cargo weight. 

Data Source: Use emission factors from the Carbon Interface API or data from climatetrace.org to calculate carbon emissions. 

Key Components: 

Data Collection: Gather carbon emission factors for each transportation mode and apply them to simulated cargo data. 

Algorithm: Calculate emissions based on mode, distance, and weight, using standard emissions calculations. 

Dashboard: Build an interactive dashboard showing emissions by transport mode, with a visual comparison of the environmental impact.
